<p>The direction of the jump is controlled by mouse position, pressing the left mouse click charges the jump, releasing the left mouse click makes the slime jump</p>

<p>Whenever the player hits something that will kill the slime, the slime is respawned. The position of the respawn will be a "default respawn location" set in the inspector, or, if available the last valid player position</p>


<h2>Levels</h2>

<p>Two simple levels, objective is to get to the blue portal to advance to next level. Red spots mark positions that can be "sticked" to. Also added a "Spawn Point" to specify where the player should spawn, if no spawnpoint is defined, default values are used instead.</p>
